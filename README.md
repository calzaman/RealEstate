# RealEstate
In this project we take realestate data of houses' characteristics as labels.  Then I use Neural Networks to predict if an given house in below or above median price.  
So suppose you are looking for a specific LotArea,	OverallQual,	OverallCond,	total basement size,	number of FullBathroom, number of BedroomAbvGr, availability of Fireplace, Garage Area, this program can predict is such house would be above or below median price.
